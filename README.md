# bfci
BrainF*ck Compiling Interpreter. I made it to run brainf*ck code at an acceptable speed.

Doesn't compile to true bytecode, just to an internal data structure which is then interpreted.

## How to compile
Compile using `make` or `make compile`, and then install it to /usr/local/bin by running `make install` as root.

## How to use
Run brainf*ck program with command `bfci <file>`.
